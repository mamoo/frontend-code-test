# Frontend Code Test
### this is a fork of: [datascienceinc/frontend-code-test](https://github.com/datascienceinc/frontend-code-test)

## Introduction
This is an at-home exercise for frontend and full-stack developers.

## Instructions
* Clone this repo
* Complete the exercise and submit either a zip of the solution or a link to a new repo
* You may use any resources, frameworks, libraries, etc and style the markup however you like, but please keep the code clean

## Requirements
Using the provided JSON data `recipes.json`, representing a collection of meal recipes, create a micro frontend application that meets the following criteria:

1. Display a list (or table) of recipes.
2. Allow filtering of recipes by a single ingredient.
3. Add checkboxes to allow selection of multiple recipes.
4. Show an alphabetically ordered list of distinct ingredients for the selected recipes. This should update as recipes are selected / unselected.
5. Persist the selections locally and regenerate the view on page refresh.

The above criteria are sorted by priority. The project should come with a README note outlining any required setup to be able to run the app, such as modifying hosts file, etc. as well as any other useful info.

## Bonus
Tests validating the logic are much appreciated.
